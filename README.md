# Wave-Beam
Base code for wave beam using Allegro
Beam 3 description: We changed the y value of the beam from 10 to 67 which caused the wave of the beam to get taller and shorter as it continues across the screen.
Beam 2 description; We changed the x value which made the wave longer and wider from the top of each wave 
Beam 1 description; We changed again the y value from 10 to 30 which made the beam zig zag while going down
